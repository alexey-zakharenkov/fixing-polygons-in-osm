        <h1>OSM Polygons Statistics</h1>

        <p>This page shows several statistics related to multipolygons over time.</p>

        <h2>Multipolygons created from relations</h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_from_relations"></div>

        <p>The number of multipolygons created from relations with
        <tt>type=multipolygon</tt> or <tt>type=boundary</tt>.</p>

        <h2>Multipolygons created from closed ways</h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_from_ways"></div>

        <p>The number of (multi)polygons created from closed ways. Tags are not
        taken into account (except <tt>area=no</tt>), so this also includes
        closed ways that are not actually polygons, such as roundabouts or so.</p>

        <h2>Nodes in multipolygons</h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_nodes"></div>

        <p>The total number of nodes in all multipolygons (created from
        relations or ways).</p>

        <h2>Old style multipolygons</h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_no_tags_on_relation"></div>

        <p>The number of multipolygon relations that have no tags (or only
        unimportant ones like <tt>created_by</tt>) on the relation and have
        their tags on the outer way(s) instead. This <i>old style</i> tagging
        is deprecated.</p>

        <h2><a id="intersections">Errors: Intersections</a></h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_intersections"></div>

        <p>Multipolygon relations or ways with self-intersections of the way
        or ways involved. These are broken and need to be fixed. The number
        reported here is the number of crossing segments. Because you always
        have at least two segments involved in an intersection, the number
        of affected (multi)polygons is about half this size.</p>

        <h2><a id="duplicate_nodes">Errors: Duplicate nodes</a></h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_duplicate_nodes"></div>

        <p>Multipolygon relations or ways with consecutive indentical nodes
        or multiple different nodes at the same location. These are usually
        fixed while post-processing the multipolygon, but it is still better
        to fix them in the data.</p>

        <h2><a id="duplicate_segments">Errors: Duplicate segments</a></h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_duplicate_segments"></div>

        <p>Number of segments (a segment is a connection between two nodes)
        that appear multiple times in the border of a multipolygon relation
        or way. This is often, but not always wrong.</p>

        <h2><a id="open_rings">Errors: Open rings</a></h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_open_rings"></div>

        <p>Multipolygon relation where the outer or inner border is not closed.
        This is always an error and needs to be fixed.</p>

        <h2>Errors: Inner rings with same tags as outer rings</h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_inner_with_same_tags"></div>

        <p>Some multipolygon relations have the same tags on outer and inner
        ways or the relation and inner ways. This is deprecated. Multipolygon
        tags should be on the relation only, outer ways are usually not tagged
        at all (unless they constitute an object in their own right), and inner
        rings either have no tags or their own tags if they constitute an
        object in their own right.</p>

        <h2>Errors: Wrong role</h2>
        <div class="canvas" id="canvas_wrong_role"></div>

        <p>Multipolygon member roles other than empty, <tt>outer</tt> or
        <tt>inner</tt> or where the tagged role is not correct one. This
        reports the number of segments which have a wrong role, not the
        number of ways or relations. That's why this number is so large.</p>
