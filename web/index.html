<h1>Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many different ways (multi)polygons in OpenStreetMap can be mapped
correctly and there are even more ways in which they can be mapped incorrectly.
Of the over 260 million (multi)polygons in OSM more than 100,000 contain
mapping errors of one kind or another and about 250,000 are tagged <i>old
style</i> (with tags on the outer ways instead of on the relation) making
multipolygon tagging and processing much more complicated and much more
expensive than it needs to be. But this is not only about multipolygon
relations, it is also about polygons created from closed ways. They also can
and do have errors.</p>

<p>We are trying to fix all this and this web site is here to organize this effort.</p>

<p>When we have finished this effort, <b>mapping will be easier</b>, because
there will be only one canonical way of tagging multipolygons. Editors can take
this into account and help mappers in better ways. And it will make <b>using
the data easier and faster</b> because the programs (such as Osm2pgsql and
Osmium) converting OSM data into multipolygons for rendering or other uses can
be simplified. It will also make it easier to detect mapping errors <b>raising
the quality of the OSM data</b>.</p>

<h2><img src="/img/map-64.png" width="16" height="16"/> <a href="/map/index.html">Old-style multipolygon comparison map</a></h2>

<p>To see what the map would look like if we didn't handle <i>old style</i>
multipolygons specially, but just render everything according to the <i>new
style</i> rules, you can use our <a href="/map/index.html">comparison
map</a>.</p>

<p>There are some areas in central Europe with a lot of (or larger)
<i>old style</i> multipolygons. Some other clusters can be seen
here:
<a href="/map/index.html#8/62.023/29.152">Finland</a>,
<a href="/map/index.html#7/32.893/-83.199">Georgia, USA</a>,
