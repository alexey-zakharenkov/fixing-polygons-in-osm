<h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time.</p>

<p>The priority for the following jobs is specified according to the visibility
of the problems on the map: The priority "High" is for larger (multi)polygons
such as forests that can possibly affect a large map area. "Low" is used for
problems that are invisible or nearly invisible on usual maps. "Medium" is for
everything in between, such as buildings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="maproulette">Using Maproulette</h2>

<p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
the more complex problems.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="ways-with-a-single-node">Ways with a single node</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-15</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> These are ways that contain only a single node. Sometimes the same node is in the way multiple times. Some of these will be detected as polygons, because the first and last node are the same, so they are closed ways. They contain neither a proper line geometry nor a proper polygon geometry, so they need to be removed or fixed.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> This is the location of a way containing a single node one or more times. Look at the tags and decide what to do with the way. Most can probably be deleted, but maybe the tags are still useful.</p>

    <p>A tip: Using a JOSM filter like <tt>type:way nodes:1 OR nodes:2</tt> makes it easier to see where the case are.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2401">Americas</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2400">Europe</a></li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2402">Rest of the World</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h2 id="osm-inspector">Using the OSM Inspector</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-duplicate-nodes">Fixing duplicate nodes</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> One very simple task is to fix duplicate nodes using
    OSMI and JOSM. Duplicate nodes are two nodes at the same position or one
    node that is in a way twice.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and only
    activate the duplicate nodes layers. Find an area you want to fix
    with lots of orange dots and load it into JOSM (using the edit button
    with the little "J" in it). Activate the validator in JOSM and run it.
    Click on the "Mixed type duplicated nodes" warning and then the "Fix"
    button to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-old-style-multipolygons-with-josm">Fixing old-style multipolygons with JOSM</h2>

<p>We are currently focusing more on fixing geometrically invalid
(multi)polygons, but if you want to get started on fixing the old-style
multipolygons, that's great, too.</p>

<p>Fixing old-style multipolygons isn't very difficult with JOSM. Look at this
<a href="old-style-josm.html">step-by-step description</a> which also has
a lot of handy "productivity" tips.</p>
