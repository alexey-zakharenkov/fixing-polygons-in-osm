        <h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

        <p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
        skill level and experience with OSM.</p>

        <h2>Maproulette</h2>

        <p>We have created several Maproulette challenges that even a beginner
        can use.</p>

        <p>Currently there is only one challenge available. We will provide
        more challenges in the future, but wanted to start out with a simple
        challenge that is easy to create (for us) and has problems that are
        easy to fix (for you). Once we gain some experience with the whole
        process, other challenges will follow.</p>

        <h2>Self-Intersecting Building Outlines</h2>

        <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
        <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-14</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Building outlines made from a single way that
        intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
        fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 100 nodes
        show up.</p>

        <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
        verify that there is a building. Often the intersection is due to a
        node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
        and you can simply merge those nodes.</p>

        <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1478">Africa</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1479">Asia</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1480">Australia</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1481">Europe</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1482">India</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1483">North America</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1484">South America</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>OSM Inspector</h2>

        <p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
        View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
        about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
        can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
        up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>
