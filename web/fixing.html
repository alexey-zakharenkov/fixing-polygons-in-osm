<h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time.</p>

<p>The priority for the following jobs is specified according to the visibility
of the problems on the map: The priority "High" is for larger (multi)polygons
such as forests that can possibly affect a large map area. "Low" is used for
problems that are invisible or nearly invisible on usual maps. "Medium" is for
everything in between, such as buildings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="maproulette">Using Maproulette</h2>

<p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
the more complex problems.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="self-intersecting-polygon-ways">Self-Intersecting Polygon Ways</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-04</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Building, landuse, or natural polygon outlines made
    from a single way that intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid
    polygons that should be fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images
    to verify that the way is tagged correctly. Often the intersection is due
    to a node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply remove one or merge those nodes.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1504">Africa</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1505">Americas</a></li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1506">Asia + Australia</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1503">Europe</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="self-intersecting-multipolygon-relations">Self-Intersecting Multipolygon Relations</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Difficult</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-11</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Building, landuse, or natural multipolygon outlines from multipolygon relations that intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection(s). Use the aerial images to verify that the relations and ways are tagged correctly. Check that the tags for the multipolygon are all on the relation, not the ways.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2375">Africa</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2376">Americas</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2377">Asia + Australia</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2378">Europe</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2379">France</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2380">India</a></li>

    </ul>

<h2 id="osm-inspector">Using the OSM Inspector</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-duplicate-nodes">Fixing duplicate nodes</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> One very simple task is to fix duplicate nodes using
    OSMI and JOSM. Duplicate nodes are two nodes at the same position or one
    node that is in a way twice.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and only
    activate the duplicate nodes layers. Find an area you want to fix
    with lots of orange dots and load it into JOSM (using the edit button
    with the little "J" in it). Activate the validator in JOSM and run it.
    Click on the "Mixed type duplicated nodes" warning and then the "Fix"
    button to fix them.</p>
