<p>Several <a href="fixing.html#maproulette">Maproulette challenges</a> have
already been done. They are linked here for reference. But there is <a
href="fixing.html">more to do</a>.</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="self-intersecting-building-outlines">Self-Intersecting Building Outlines (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-14</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Building outlines made from a single way that
    intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 100 nodes
    show up.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
    verify that there is a building. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply merge those nodes.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="self-intersecting-landuse-outlines">Self-Intersecting Landuse Outlines (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-02-26</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Landuse outlines made from a single way that
    intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 50 nodes
    show up.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
    verify that the landuse is correctly tagged. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply remove one of the nodes or merge the nodes.</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="open-rings">Open Rings (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-04</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations containing an unclosed
    ring. So the boundary of the (multi)polygon is not closed. These can
    not be rendered and must be fixed. Only relations with less than 100
    nodes are show and only if the distance between the open ends is small.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Lines show the ring with the markers at the open ends.
    Look at the aerial images first and determine
    whether the multipolygon makes sense. Often it can be removed, because
    there is another (complete) polygon or multipolygon that already does its
    job. If it can be removed, make sure to remove the multipolygon relation
    as well as all the member ways that are not needed for something else.
    If it needs to be kept, close the ring by drawing a new way over
    the the gap or extend an existing way. Some of these need local
    knowledge to fix.</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="wrong-role-inner">Wrong role (should be inner) (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-24</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-07</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Ways that are in a multipolygon relation with the
    wrong role. Only roles 'inner' and 'outer' are allowed and these ways
    should have role 'inner'.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> This is a way that is in a multipolygon relation and
    the computer thinks it should have the role 'inner'. Verify that this is
    correct and set the right role. False-positives are possible. Sometimes the
    role contains some useful information that can be moved into a tag. Ways
    are often in multiple relations, make sure you fix the right one!</p>
