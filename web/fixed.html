<p>Several <a href="fixing.html#maproulette">Maproulette challenges</a> have
already been done. They are linked here for reference. But there is <a
href="fixing.html">more to do</a>.</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="self-intersecting-building-outlines">Self-Intersecting Building Outlines (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-14</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Building outlines made from a single way that
    intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 100 nodes
    show up.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
    verify that there is a building. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply merge those nodes.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-02-26</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Landuse outlines made from a single way that
    intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 50 nodes
    show up.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
    verify that the landuse is correctly tagged. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply remove one of the nodes or merge the nodes.</p>

    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-04</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations containing an unclosed
    ring. So the boundary of the (multi)polygon is not closed. These can
    not be rendered and must be fixed. Only relations with less than 100
    nodes are show and only if the distance between the open ends is small.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Lines show the ring with the markers at the open ends.
    Look at the aerial images first and determine
    whether the multipolygon makes sense. Often it can be removed, because
    there is another (complete) polygon or multipolygon that already does its
    job. If it can be removed, make sure to remove the multipolygon relation
    as well as all the member ways that are not needed for something else.
    If it needs to be kept, close the ring by drawing a new way over
    the the gap or extend an existing way. Some of these need local
    knowledge to fix.</p>

    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-07</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Ways that are in a multipolygon relation with the
    wrong role. Only roles 'inner' and 'outer' are allowed and these ways
    should have role 'inner'.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> This is a way that is in a multipolygon relation and
    the computer thinks it should have the role 'inner'. Verify that this is
    correct and set the right role. False-positives are possible. Sometimes the
    role contains some useful information that can be moved into a tag. Ways
    are often in multiple relations, make sure you fix the right one!</p>

    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-15</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-18</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> These are ways that contain only a single node. Sometimes the same node is in the way multiple times. Some of these will be detected as polygons, because the first and last node are the same, so they are closed ways. They contain neither a proper line geometry nor a proper polygon geometry, so they need to be removed or fixed.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> This is the location of a way containing a single node one or more times. Look at the tags and decide what to do with the way. Most can probably be deleted, but maybe the tags are still useful.</p>

    <p>A tip: Using a JOSM filter like <tt>type:way nodes:1 OR nodes:2</tt> makes it easier to see where the case are.</p>

    <h3 id="duplicate-segments-in-closed-ways">Duplicate segments in closed ways (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-18</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-26</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> There are many cases of <i>duplicate segments</i> where a closed way doubles back on itself. Usually they are left over from way back before we had multipolygons or they are from mappers who don't know about multipolygon relations and are creating several outer or inner rings by "connecting" those rings with parts of a way. There are two common cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two or more outer rings connected</li>
        <li>Outer and inner rings connected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other cases than this are possible, too.</p>

    <p>Here is an illustration of the first case, where outer rings connect to other outer rings. This is either fixed by having separate closed ways (if the ways can stand by themselves, for instance if they are just forest polygons), or by creating a proper multipolygon relation (if the ways can't stand by themselves, for instance when they form two parts of an area with a common name). You have to look at the tags to decide which case you have.</p>
    <img src="/img/connected-polygons.png"/>

    <p>And here is an illustration of the second case, where outer rings connect to inner rings. This is usually fixed by creating a proper multipolygon relation.</p>
    <img src="/img/fake-inner.png"/>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> The segment(s) connecting two different rings of a multipolygon are shown. Remove the connecting segment(s) and create a proper multipolygon or separate (closed way) polygons. In JOSM "Tools/Join overlapping Areas" and "Tools/Create multipolygon" can often be used to do this quickly.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> The line(s) shows ways that are multiple times
    in a multipolygon relation. This is always wrong. Load into JOSM, open
    the relation in the relations editor and remove one instance of the way.
    Check for other problems with the relation.</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations containing an unclosed
    ring. So the boundary of the (multi)polygon is not closed. These can
    not be rendered and must be fixed. Careful, many of these are small, but
    some of them are huge!</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Lines show the ring with the markers at the open
    ends. Look at the aerial images first and determine whether the
    multipolygon makes sense. Often it can be removed, because there is another
    (complete) polygon or multipolygon that already does its job. If it can be
    removed, make sure to remove the multipolygon relation as well as all the
    member ways that are not needed for something else. If it needs to be kept,
    close the ring by drawing a new way over the gap or extend an existing way.
    Some of these need local knowledge to fix. Do not spend too much time on
    these tasks, if it looks to hard, just mark it as "Too hard to fix".</p>
