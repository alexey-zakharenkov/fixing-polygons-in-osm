    <h3 id="self-intersecting-building-outlines">Self-Intersecting Building Outlines (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-14</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Building outlines made from a single way that
    intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 100 nodes
    show up.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
    verify that there is a building. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply merge those nodes.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations containing an unclosed
    ring. So the boundary of the (multi)polygon is not closed. These can
    not be rendered and must be fixed. Only relations with less than 100
    nodes are show and only if the distance between the open ends is small.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Lines show the ring with the markers at the open ends.
    Look at the aerial images first and determine
    whether the multipolygon makes sense. Often it can be removed, because
    there is another (complete) polygon or multipolygon that already does its
    job. If it can be removed, make sure to remove the multipolygon relation
    as well as all the member ways that are not needed for something else.
    If it needs to be kept, close the ring by drawing a new way over
    the the gap or extend an existing way. Some of these need local
    knowledge to fix.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> This is a way that is in a multipolygon relation and
    the computer thinks it should have the role 'inner'. Verify that this is
    correct and set the right role. False-positives are possible. Sometimes the
    role contains some useful information that can be moved into a tag. Ways
    are often in multiple relations, make sure you fix the right one!</p>

    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-18</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> These are ways that contain only a single node. Sometimes the same node is in the way multiple times. Some of these will be detected as polygons, because the first and last node are the same, so they are closed ways. They contain neither a proper line geometry nor a proper polygon geometry, so they need to be removed or fixed.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> This is the location of a way containing a single node one or more times. Look at the tags and decide what to do with the way. Most can probably be deleted, but maybe the tags are still useful.</p>

    <p>A tip: Using a JOSM filter like <tt>type:way nodes:1 OR nodes:2</tt> makes it easier to see where the case are.</p>

    <h3 id="duplicate-segments-in-closed-ways">Duplicate segments in closed ways (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-18</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-03-26</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> There are many cases of <i>duplicate segments</i> where a closed way doubles back on itself. Usually they are left over from way back before we had multipolygons or they are from mappers who don't know about multipolygon relations and are creating several outer or inner rings by "connecting" those rings with parts of a way. There are two common cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two or more outer rings connected</li>
        <li>Outer and inner rings connected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other cases than this are possible, too.</p>

    <p>Here is an illustration of the first case, where outer rings connect to other outer rings. This is either fixed by having separate closed ways (if the ways can stand by themselves, for instance if they are just forest polygons), or by creating a proper multipolygon relation (if the ways can't stand by themselves, for instance when they form two parts of an area with a common name). You have to look at the tags to decide which case you have.</p>
    <img src="/img/connected-polygons.png"/>

    <p>And here is an illustration of the second case, where outer rings connect to inner rings. This is usually fixed by creating a proper multipolygon relation.</p>
    <img src="/img/fake-inner.png"/>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> The segment(s) connecting two different rings of a multipolygon are shown. Remove the connecting segment(s) and create a proper multipolygon or separate (closed way) polygons. In JOSM "Tools/Join overlapping Areas" and "Tools/Create multipolygon" can often be used to do this quickly.</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Sometimes ways contain "spikes" where the way

    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-05-27</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> The inner ways in a multipolygon relation must
    have different tags than the relation. If they have the same tag, why
    are they there at all? This is often a remnant of very old tagging, or
    it simply can be an error.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> The line shows a multipolygon relation member way
    that has the same tags as its relation. Look at the tags on the relation
    and *all* members and make sure they make sense. Outer and inner ways
    should either have no tags at all or tags only pertaining to those ways.
    The relation should only have tags pertaining to the whole multipolygon.
    You also have to look at the other data in the area, sometimes the problem
    is duplication of data.</p>

    the Netherlands have a huge amount of those issues, so they get their

    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-05-29</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-06-09</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations with self-intersections
    Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection(s). Use the aerial
    images to verify. Often the intersection is due to a node near (or directly
    on top of) another node at one of the corners and you can simply merge those
    nodes.</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Areas (buildings, landuse, natural) made from a
    single way that intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid
    polygons that should be fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images
    to verify correctness of data. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply merge those nodes.</p>

    <h3 id="same-tags">Same tags on member ways (Job was cancelled)</h3>

    <p><b>This job was cancelled. It will be restarted
    in a slightly different way taking different tags into account.</b></p>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-06-18</p>
    <p><b>Challenge cancelled:</b> 2017-06-20</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Quite often some of the outer or inner ways in a
    multipolygon relation have the same tags as the relation itself. This is
    wrong and leads to wrong renderings. Note that some tags can be the same,
    say you have a coniferous forest with a deciduous forest in the middle. But
    all tags being the same doesn't make sense. (Certain tags such as "source"
    are ignored in this comparison.) A member way should only have the tags
    describing that specific way only, not anything belonging to the whole
    multipolygon.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Displayed are ways that are a member of a
    multipolygon relation and have the same tags as the relation. Look at the
    tags of the relation and all member ways and figure out what's right. Look
    at satellite images to help guide you.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region. There are
    currently only two, more are to come:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2610">South America</a></strike></li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2611">Switzerland</a></strike></li>
